# Algorithm theory experiments.


This project mainly consists of two experiments：

- Test1: Large integer multiplication.

- Test2: Semantic location SKYLINE queries based on RDF graphs.


## Test1
***
### 1.Main work

Three algorithms of large integer multiplication are implemented in C++ programming language, including:
- Vanilla multiply.
- Divide and conquer multiply.
- Improved divide and conquer multiply.
